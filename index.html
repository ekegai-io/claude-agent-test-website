        <ul>
            <li>Everything is always subject to change, everything is a draft (code, documents, processesâ€¦).</li>

        <h2>How to Work with Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm an introvert. I don't care about small talk, if you need something from me, shoot.</li>
            <li>I may often have a serious look on my face, but underneath I am giggler.</li>
            <li>I appreciate giving and receiving direct feedback (cf. Radical Candor). If I messed up, I want to be the first one to hear it and learn from it.</li>
            <li>I have strong opinions, but I hold them loosely. I easily change my mind based on new data and information.</li>
            <li>I try to say what I do, and do what I say, and have a tendency to expect that from others.</li>
            <li>One problem at the time. I like to break down ideas and issues into the smallest scope possible.</li>
            <li>I prefer async communication when suitable but if you need to book a meeting with me, prioritise afternoons and provide a clear ask or agenda so that I can prepare.</li>
            <li>I am a "skeptical optimist" high chance of failing but happy to learn and believe eventually we will figure things out</li>
        </ul>
